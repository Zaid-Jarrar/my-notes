## SUMMARY:
- Alwaus look at the purpose for creating your software and how it can help the users and make it easy to read and understand for other developers. 

- Always think about how to stay as simiple as it can be and reduce code lines. 

- Never think too far into the future, otherwise the software will be needlessly more complex

- Strive for simplicity not complexity.

- Never underestimate the maintianance thats require for the software, build solid fondations to help ease your work later on.

- Always test your code before shipping it out. 

- Again with the simplicity, choose a consistant approach to your code.
